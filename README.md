## Major: Information Systems

This project relates to my major because forums utilize servers to store user informtation and posts in order to keep track of who is making a post or commenting on a post.

## Purpose

This website is for students in any of the computer science majors to get help or post about anything computer science related. Could be getting help with classes, something they are working on by themselves, or just trying to make friends. This can be used any way a student wants to use it.

## Usage

- Open your browser
- Navigate to the website
- Create an account or log in
- Read/post on the forum

## Future Development

This site could be used as more then a forum. Could also be used as a type of social media for students. Just adding a few things like a chat system, access to view other people profiles, and sending friend requests could make this more than a plain forum.

## Dependencies

None
